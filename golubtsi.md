# Method

## Cabbage

- Prepare an ice bath, bring a pot of water to a boil. Boil the cabbage leaves for 1.5-2 minutes until pliable. Transfer directly into the ice bath and then to a paper sheet to dry.

- Heat canola oil over medium-high heat. Add shredded carrot and half of your finely chopped onions, salt to taste, cook until soft. Add tomato paste and sugar, cook until browned. Add chopped tomatoes, water, and bay leaves, salt to taste. Reduce this mixture quite a bit (15-20 minutes; maybe more). Taste and salt again if it needs it. Remove from heat.

- Add ground beef, ground pork, parboiled rice, onion, salt to a bowl and mix until combined.

- Create a number of... uhh... meat logs (?) equal to the number of cabbage leaves you have.

- Put the meat into the middle of the cabbage leaf and fold the sides over and roll until you run out of cabbage.

- Place the cabbage dumplings into the pot, with the stem facing down. Bring the pot back to a simmer over medium-high heat.

- Reduce the heat, slightly cover with a lid and cook for 35-45 minutes or until the filling is cooked through.

## Bread and Sauce

- Toast your bread; melt butter in a pan, add bread over medium low heat

- Add sour cream to a bowl with some magic amount of harissa (idk you just gotta feel it) and mix until combined

OR

- Chop your dill, add sour cream to a bowl take half of your dill and mix it with the sour cream until combined

## Plating

I'm not really sure how it's typically served. I tried a bunch of things here. As far as eating it, I think my favorite thing was to serve it like a toast.
